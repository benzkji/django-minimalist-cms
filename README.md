# django-mini-cms

The minimalist cms, with three plugable base core modules. That are

- A toolbar for your frontend, allows login/logout, and model editing directly in the frontend
- A dynamic content framework, that allows hierarchical content on any model, always based on the same content types
- A page tree module, for building page trees

All three are optional, whereas the toolbar is probably needed in most cases.
